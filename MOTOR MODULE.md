# MOTOR MODULE


---

The DC motor rotates a shaft when it receives a signal.The more signal it receives, the faster the motor will spin. The DC (or “direct current”) motor rotates a shaft when you send it a signal. The CW/CCW (clockwise and counter-clockwise) switch controls the direction it rotates.



It has two modes. 

In B mode, the switch on the board lets you choose which direction the motor spins. CW spins clockwise and CCW spins counterclockwise. 

When the switch is in A mode, the amount of signal the motor receives from previous Bits allows you to control the speed and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of its motion. In this mode, using an input like the rotation sensor makes steering easy!
